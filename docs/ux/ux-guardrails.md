# UX Guardrails & Patterns
- One primary action per view; secondaries demoted.
- Progressive disclosure; Advanced section.
- Drafts autosave for forms >3 fields; confirm before nav away.
- Sticky header (64px); deterministic tables; bulk actions on selection.
- Empty states: teach + sample + single CTA.
- A11y checklist: focus order, traps, labels, Esc/Enter bindings.
- Performance budgets: TTI <2.5s; route switch <500ms; table ops <150ms.
